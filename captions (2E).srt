1
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:18,779
Sorry to keep you waiting. I know until now
I will report the situation

2
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,800
This is the paper you have
Anyway, for now, read aloud

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:33,450
Let me do it. In this
Of our ship headquartered in Germany

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,140
Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM) managing
That

5
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:51,100
The company is currently using the ship (Kokuka Courageous)
Khor Fakkan, which is a UAE port,

6
00:00:51,125 --> 00:01:00,656
Like pulling a ship (Kokuka Courageous) on it with a tag board
Work has begun.

7
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:08,674
I said yesterday about this matter
As I said, by this accident

8
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:15,720
The Vessel (Kokuka Courageous)
Damage has occurred.

9
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:24,310
Therefore, take care of the crew
Has all been departed once.

10
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:34,020
Then the U.S. military
Crew members are all supported

11
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:42,600
I boarded the ship again, until now
Of the ship that was not functioning

12
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:51,220
The backup power supply has been restored. Currently, Kokuka Courageous
The ship is in its condition

13
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:58,100
Things are stable.
Damage such as comprehensive damage

14
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:04,759
And the like, but the sinking
There is no possibility. And

15
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:13,430
There is no loss of cargo and fuel.
One person from Kokuka Courageous

16
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:21,290
Reported minor injuries
, But this is the bullet

17
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:27,840
It ’s because of injury
When jumping into the sea when leaving the ship,

18
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,650
I jump into the sea, so at that time
Is still unknown

19
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:41,590
is. However, U.S. military ships
At the time of boarding the U.S. military

20
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:52,260
I took it firmly,
Medical allowance

21
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:59,560
Because I have you
The person is on board now.

22
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,570
The ship (Kokuka Courageous) is now
In other words, Fujairah Port الفجيرة

23
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:11,818
By the way, 70 miles to here
Is located 16 miles offshore of Iran.

24
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:18,720
In this regard we
All have branches in Singapore

25
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,390
German company BSM
Abbreviation for the company Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement I mentioned earlier.

26
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:35,000
Through the BSM.
Actively monitor and if further details are found

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,879
Separately
I will explain. that's all.

28
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:49,369
If you have any questions, please accept them. Yes.

29
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:59,069
(Question) The United States has indicated the possibility of a mine attack.

30
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:07,069
(Answer) Not at all. Because the waterline,
The sea, the point of contact between the sea surface and the ship

31
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:13,660
Because it goes above it (the damage mark)
It is definitely underwater if it is a torpedo

32
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,506
I don `t go. I think that is a false alarm.

33
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:32,539
(Question) This is NHK. You have released footage of the U.S. military recall, but have you seen that?

34
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,355
(Answer) We have not entered yet.

35
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:44,129
(Question) Have you seen the video? (Answer) Yes. On the contrary, I want to see it now

36
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:49,960
Though it is about. Regarding the news,
We have not yet entered from BSM.

37
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,051
Unfortunately. Not yet (that information).

38
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:58,655
(Question) Why did you say this was impossible?
(Answer) What is impossible?

39
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:07,460
(Question) Could you tell us why you said there was no mine attack?
(Answer) The basis is that the torpedo is below the surface

40
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:13,869
Because it does not collide on the water surface,

41
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:20,270
The point where the shell landed is well above the surface of the water.
So definitely

42
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,237
I explain that it is not a torpedo.

43
00:05:23,262 --> 00:05:27,889
(Question) Number of attacks

44
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:38,919
Do you know where the damage is?
(Answer) I think I explained yesterday,

45
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:48,039
Well, it's behind the ship
Close to the fuel tank there

46
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:55,530
At first we have landed. The second shot
Yesterday, Manifold, deck

47
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,684
Unload the cargo above
It is where the pipe to be put is in,

48
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:05,740
Said it landed there
Information was included and entered,

49
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,800
So far it was a misinformation
It is feeling. For the second shot,

50
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:20,870
Near the center of
There is a small hole above the sea level

51
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,649
Because it seems to be like that,
This is the situation I know now.

52
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:38,580
(Question) There is a small hole on the side of the ship ...
(Answer) It's a public photo of the ship and everyone

53
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,999
You can see it.
It looks like it was not a deck.

54
00:06:43,999 --> 00:07:01,939
(Question) What will be done in the future after the spare power of the Vessel (Kokuka Courageous) is restored? About that point. Will your company review your shipping routes in the future?

55
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:10,860
(Answer) Now, the seafarer re-boarded on board, as I said yesterday,

56
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:17,599
Inject CO2 into the engine room
Going to prevent fire

57
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:25,839
We have a regular generator etc.
To get it working again

58
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:34,340
Emissions including CO2 are discharged outboard
Otherwise you will not be able to enter the ship

59
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:43,300
Doing that first
The first problem.

60
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,879
And the spare power supply is in another place
So its spare power, this is the battery

61
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,279
There are also types
Navigating instrument after moving it

62
00:07:53,279 --> 00:08:00,113
Well, I started by moving such things first.

63
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:01,039
(Question) What about then?

64
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,029
(Answer) After that, in the future
The ship carries 225,000 tons of methanol,

65
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:12,129
The problem of restoration, of course,
So here we are

66
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:16,199
Call Fakkan, as you write,
Although this is not fixed,

67
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:23,129
Tow this (Call Fakkan) direction
If there is a harbor, port again

68
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:29,179
Authority, only with the permission of the Port Authority
Bring it up there and there

69
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:35,053
Enter the task of transshipping luggage
We are preparing like this.

70
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:37,279
(Question) When is it going to be?

71
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,270
(Answer) I can not predict at all. Still tugboat
But one of them is small

72
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:49,740
It is a situation where (the ship) cannot run.
In the meantime, a US ship is nearby

73
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:56,389
Escort me, helicopter, etc.
Fly over the ship, no more

74
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:01,032
He / she assists you not to be attacked.

75
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:09,482
(Question) As your company, the impact on the operation of

76
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:18,695
(Answer) There is a possibility that it will come out, but at the moment, the route selection will be reviewed

77
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:32,660
From the Persian Gulf, when it comes to carrying luggage,
Including crude oil, unless this route is closed

78
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:39,203
The ship will be operated with the consent of the seafarers.

79
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:46,120
(Question) Do you transfer goods to your ship?

80
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:56,201
(Answer) It is not necessarily our ship.
Anyway, I want to find the earliest ship and transship to that ship.

81
00:09:56,226 --> 00:10:00,836
(Question) Do you outsource operations to another company?

82
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:01,774
(Answer) Which operation?

83
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,401
(Question) Ship operation.

84
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:06,696
(Answer) No, we do not entrust our ship to another company.

85
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:09,860
(Question) So, you mean chartering?

86
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,870
(Answer) Yes. Charter and transship to another ship
Because it is

87
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,638


88
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:31,070
(Question) About the situation where the crew was attacked

89
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:39,480
(Answer) Regarding the matter, both from BSM and sailors.
There is no direct contact.

90
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,639
When I arrive at a safe port for the time being
Again from BSM Singapore

91
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:51,353
Send overseers and others,
We issue a report including the situation collection.

92
00:10:52,900 --> 00:11:01,880
(Question) Is Khor Fakkan the UAE?

93
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:13,451
(Answer) Khor Fakkan is described as Oman (in the distributed material), but there is the Gulf of Oman and it is UAE.

94
00:11:13,476 --> 00:11:25,680
(Question) Indicate where the second shell (receiving place) was received in the photo because it was different from the announcement yesterday

95
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:42,980
(Answer) The first shot is around here, apart from starboard and port. The second shot is around here.

96
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:54,430
You mentioned a torpedo earlier, but the torpedo has this ship and the sea surface,
Only below this line

97
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:01,339
Because the torpedo does not go, we have received (attack)
It's just above this. Since both shots are above

98
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:08,425
The torpedo has no chance.
(Question) Is it the same for mines as for torpedoes? (I'm talking about torpedoes) Is it the same for mines?

99
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:20,964
(Answer) Mines are just floating in the water. Floating or
Place the ship at a depth just below the sea surface, and explode when touched

100
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:27,041
No damage at sea level.

101
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:31,828
(Question) Is there anything (explosives) to be pasted on the side?

102
00:12:31,853 --> 00:12:32,961
(Answer) What does that mean?

103
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,303
(Question) Like a timed bomb

104
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:38,106
(answer)

105
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:44,740
The crew of the Vessel said, "I was attacked by a flying object."
Bomb on that side

106
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,519
Or a time bomb,
I do not think that.

107
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,767
(Question) Does it mean that the crew is talking about flying objects?

108
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:54,618
(Answer) Yes.

109
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:59,706
(Question) Does the crew see the attack?

110
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:03,730
(Answer) Yes. I am watching. I do not understand the first shot.

111
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,321
(Question) Are you watching?

112
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:07,522
(Answer) Yes. The second shot.

113
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:09,384
(Question) What about the first shot?

114
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:12,339
(Answer) I don't know. "Something seems to have flown."

115
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:18,120
So an explosion pierced the hull
Such a report has come.

116
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,660
(Question) That is the first shot. Did you definitely confirm that the second shot flew visually?

117
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:27,391
(Answer) Yes. Not everyone saw it. Because people on the bridge see it.

118
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:34,522
(Question) So, do you mean that you were attacked by something that flew?

119
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,563
(Answer) Yes, it is.

120
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:38,448
(Question) Do you know the size of the flying object?

121
00:13:38,473 --> 00:13:39,110
(Answer) I don't know at all.

122
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:48,750
(Question) How fast was the speed?

123
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:58,600
(Answer) They can't judge themselves,
I do not know.

124
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,931
(Question) What is the size of the hole caused by flying objects? How much

125
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:04,930
(Answer) I haven't looked into it yet.

126
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,040
(Question) Are the first and second shots one each?

127
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:09,881
(Answer) One by one.

128
00:14:09,906 --> 00:14:14,611
(Question) Is the first shot on the starboard rear?

129
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:15,699
(Answer) Yes.

130
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:22,360
(Question) Port number 2
(Answer) Near the center. Yes yes

131
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:32,819
(Answer) (Revised) Right now, starboard and port ...
Is it true? Again, we're sorry,

132
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:37,529
We will check again, so as soon as we understand it,

133
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:39,715
Please let everyone know.

134
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:54,799
(Question) Is the first shot (where the attack was made) on the starboard side on the rear, and the second shot on the port side?

135
00:14:54,824 --> 00:14:56,240
(Answer) I don't know if they are the same.

136
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:05,535
Let me check again there.
Check the location. It is certain that we received the second shot.

137
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,789
(Question) Is the first shot on the port side?

138
00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:19,029
(Answer) From the picture
It was starboard. (But I'm not sure)

139
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:25,040
That's once again, the ship, etc.
Contact was actually made

140
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,379
Once again, the phone, the satellite they have
If you can connect to the phone etc.

141
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:33,635
I will check it.

142
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,971
(Question) What direction did you fly?

143
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:36,910
(Answer) I don't know. I don't know this at all.

144
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,199
Of course, because I ’m running,

145
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,129
I'm guessed, though.

146
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:50,449
(Question) I'd like to confirm, is it safe to say that you were on the starboard side of the first attack trace, and do you need to confirm?

147
00:15:50,449 --> 00:16:03,540
(Answer) No, check both (the position of the two attacks).
Yes. I ’ll confirm, but I ’m

148
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:13,983
As far as I can remember, (the first attack) was behind the port

149
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:16,001
(Question) What did you see and remember?

150
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:16,914
(Answer) Look at the photo.

151
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:19,598
(Question) Is it a public photo?
(Answer) Yes. Yes.

152
00:16:19,623 --> 00:16:22,114
(Question) Is that about the first attack?
(Answer) Yes, it is.

153
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,404


154
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:28,921
(Question) The second shot is on the port as far as the picture shows
(Answer) Feeling like (same port as the first shot).

155
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:33,255
(Question) Is the paper (handout) you received on the first day wrong?
(Answer) It may be wrong.

156
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:40,036
(Question) About the direction I flew ...
(Answer) Until then, we have not checked. I'm sorry.

00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:50,599
(Question) How many US Navy escorts are there?
(Answer) There is no report on the number of vessels.

158
00:16:50,624 --> 00:16:56,973
(Answer) There is no report on whether it is one or two ships.

159
00:16:56,998 --> 00:17:05,839
(Question) What is the helicopter escort?
(Answer) We have received the escort of a helicopter flying off the US warship.

160
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:13,480
(Question) Did you see an Iranian ship around?
(Answer) There was an Iranian warship.

161
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:21,179
(Question) Does that mean that Iranian warships were around when the crew were rescued?

162
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:23,416
(Answer) Yes. At that point, Iran was around.

163
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:26,630
(Question) How is it currently being towed (by tugboat)?

164
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:30,884
(Answer) To that point, (information) has not yet entered.

165
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:34,648
(Question) Are American warships quite close (of the ship being towed)?

166
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:38,694

167
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:43,707
(Question) Do you mean running in parallel?
(Answer) Because it is not running at the same time,

168
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:51,933
(Answer) 1 knots and 2 knots are only as fast as you walk now

169
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,750
(Question) Does it feel like it is attached to the tag board? (Answer) Yes

170
00:17:54,777 --> 00:18:02,268
(Answer) And now, through BSM and insurance companies

171
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:06,604
Requesting

172
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:10,867
Schmidt, a salvage company in the Netherlands

173
00:18:10,893 --> 00:18:19,554
This company prepares a ship with a large horsepower and reaches the ship

174
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:24,063
That means that we are working

175
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:36,267
Within 24 to 36 hours from now on, we have talked about reaching the ship and restarting towing again.

176
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:41,232
(Question) The handout document states that he is being towed,

177
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:43,775
(Answer) We are towing a small boat.
(Question) so it's slow

178
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,176
(Question) Is it OK that the Vessel has restored the backup power supply?
(Answer) Yes. It has been restored.

179
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:52,785
(Question) The crew is boarding the ship because I can live on the ship.
(Answer) You can live in your residential area.

180
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:55,140
(Answer) However, the engine room cannot be entered yet.

181
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:59,912
(Question) Is it OK that the engine room is not moving?
(Answer) Yes.

182
00:18:59,937 --> 00:19:03,250
(Question) Vessel cannot sail on its own yet
(Answer) I didn't go that far.

183
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:08,275
(Question) When will you start injecting CO2 into the engine room?

184
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:23,012
(Answer) This is already done. There is a risk of fire when they escape, so first inject CO2 to prevent fire and fire spread

185
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:27,302
Injected for fire suppression.

186
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:32,596
(Question) What confirmed the Iranian Revolutionary Defense Force ship ...
(Confirmed) Not!

187
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,599
(Answer) Where did that story come from?

188
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:39,733
(Question) You mentioned earlier
(Answer) Is it a warship? I'm not saying Iranian Revolutionary Army!

189
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:44,541
(Question) Did you see the Iranian warship?
(Answer) Yes.

190
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:55,432
(Question) When did you see the Iranian warship?
(Answer) Since yesterday night of Japan time.

191
00:19:55,461 --> 00:20:01,324
(Question) Isn't he seeing (Iranian warships) when rescuing the crew?

192
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:04,381
(Answer) At that time (Iranian warships) are not coming.

193
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:10,570
(Question) Did you give any instructions from the Iranian warships?
(Answer) No. Because we have not received it at all.

194
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:20,857
(Question) How far is the Iranian warship?
(Answer) Also, because they should be talking to the US military, they will not send any news to you.

195
00:20:20,882 --> 00:20:24,761


196
00:20:24,784 --> 00:20:29,625
(Question) Will you add a tugboat and tow in the future?

197
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:41,673
(Answer) I'm asking Schmidt (salvage company) to bring one or two ships nearby as soon as possible.

198
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:49,983
(Question) One of the crew members was injured. When was the point of the injury?

199
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:51,889
(Answer) I don't know.

200
00:20:53,778 --> 00:21:04,970
(Question) In which country is the methanol in the cargo?
(Answer) Singapore and Thailand.

201
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:17,915
(Question) Please explain the location of the first attack, the second attack, and the location of the engine room with photos.

202
00:21:17,937 --> 00:21:24,372
(Answer) The engine room is located below this residential area, but slightly behind. This is the first shot.

203
00:21:25,363 --> 00:21:35,478
(Question) You are pointing to the port side, but ...
(Answer) Because the ship in this photo only shows port.

204
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:44,325
(Answer) Probably it was port. Please do not pursue it because it has not been confirmed.

205
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,327
(Question) Is that all right?
(Answer) Yes.

206
00:21:48,352 --> 00:21:57,086
(Answer) The second shot is around here. Near the center of the ship.

207
00:21:57,115 --> 00:22:09,070
(Question) Is the second shot the opposite?
(Answer) Yes. We will announce to you once more details are clear.

208
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:13,362
(Question) Is the hole not like a bullet, but a hole like a bullet?

209
00:22:13,387 --> 00:22:17,605
(Answer) I do not know this.

210
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:25,865
(Answer) If it's a burst or a penetrating bullet,
I feel like a penetrating bullet.

211
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:38,656
(Answer) If it is a explosive bullet, it explodes in various places
It must have been harmed. It is only an estimate. Guess.

212
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:46,107
(Question) It is unclear whether starboard or port has been changed, but the first damage at the rear is also
Is there a hole in one place?

213
00:22:46,132 --> 00:23:02,612
(Answer) I don't know yet. Not multiple holes,
Because it is one hole, it is not known what shape it is.

214
00:23:02,637 --> 00:23:08,827
(Question) From the US military, about the cause ...

215
00:23:08,852 --> 00:23:11,367
(Answer) What is the cause?

216
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:31,639
(Question) Images and photos with holes in the hull have already been published by the US military,
It is alleged that a wearable explosive was recovered in the video

217
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:37,855
(Answer) I do not see the video. We are collecting information now.

218
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:48,021
(Question) Last month (May 12, 2019) There is a similar thing that happened in the UAE,
The United States cares though.

219
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:55,799
(Question) Is there such a thing?

220
00:23:55,824 --> 00:23:58,716
(Answer) What is attached?

221
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:09,276
(Question) Do you check if there is something like a torpedo mounted on the hull?

222
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:25,402
(Answer) No. In general, we sail beyond our ships.
Probably none of the ships are running while checking for wearable explosives.

223
00:24:25,435 --> 00:24:30,672
(Question) There is almost no such possibility ...
(Answer) I do not.

224
00:24:30,697 --> 00:24:37,260
(Question) Explosives etc. at the time of loading
Can't you imagine wearing it? ?

225
00:24:37,285 --> 00:24:44,869
(Answer) Since we are loading (loading) in Saudi Arabia,
I don't think so.

226
00:24:44,906 --> 00:24:54,707
(Answer) As I said earlier, if you are damaged by flying objects
Since the report is included, I think that it is not a wearing thing.

227
00:24:54,732 --> 00:25:07,230
(Question) You are a flying object. Did you see more than one person?
(Answer) We do not confirm the number of people. I've heard that there are people who have seen it.

228
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:14,871
(Question)?
(Answer) There is no report.

229
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:23,922
(Question) Did you see an Iranian warship mean that the crew did?
(Answer) Of course it is.

230
00:25:23,947 --> 00:25:33,135
(Question) Could you explain what is important about the strait for the shipping industry?

231
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:56,823
(Answer) The importance of the strait? Of the route? If you don't go through it, you will not be able to transport the gasoline and heavy oil we use, such as UEA. Japan is also a lifeline.

232
00:25:56,848 --> 00:26:01,688
(Question) What about navigation other than the ship that had this incident?

233
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:11,451
(Answer) Are we our ships? Or do you include other ships? As long as no serious incidents occur at this point,

234
00:26:11,476 --> 00:26:20,506
With the consent of the sailors, the same applies to Saudi Arabia
We plan to operate the ship.

235
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:23,779
(Question) Does it mean that you can't leave?
(Answer) Yes.

236
00:26:23,804 --> 00:26:31,914
(Question) Looking at the shape of the hole you made, were you guessing it was a penetrating bullet?
(Answer) It's in the middle ...

237
00:26:31,939 --> 00:26:41,361
At the rear, no damage is visible.
It's just black (in the photo).

238
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:48,688
(Question) Is the penetrating bullet a round hole?
(Answer) Yes. Looks round.

239
00:26:48,713 --> 00:26:55,228
(Question) How many ships are you operating in the surrounding waters now?

240
00:26:55,253 --> 00:26:59,379
(Answer) Three ships. There are three ships including this one.

241
00:26:59,511 --> 00:27:05,821
(Question) Are you trying to get seafarers' consent to sail?

242
00:27:05,846 --> 00:27:10,488
(Answer) With the ship's consent,

243
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:20,977
Since it is a proposition that we ensure the safety of the sailors' lives,
If they say they ca n’t go

244
00:27:21,002 --> 00:27:24,509
You may have to give up your ship.

245
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:32,314
(Question) What is the most recent time that is planned?
(Answer) Currently, it is at the end of this month.

246
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:38,387
(Question) Are the other two vessels waiting somewhere?
(Answer) One ship is in the dock.

247
00:27:38,412 --> 00:27:47,460
(Question) Is the tonnage of the hull the largest among your tankers?
(Answer) No, not the largest, but the third.

248
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:54,940
(Question) Will you take additional defense measures in order to navigate this area in the future?

249
00:27:54,965 --> 00:28:02,226
(Answer) I don't know. I don't know what it is yet.

250
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:06,902
(Question) Is that under consideration? Do you mean that you are considering strengthening security?

251
00:28:06,927 --> 00:28:12,717
(Answer) Since this is not something we can do alone, including cooperation with other companies

252
00:28:12,742 --> 00:28:21,585
And then discuss all related matters, such as governments, insurance companies, etc.

253
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:33,780
If the insurance person says that there is no insurance if you go through the Strait of Hormuz,
In the unlikely event the company will be crushed

254
00:28:33,857 --> 00:28:37,070
It will not be able to operate.

255
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:44,400
(Question) Did you see an untrustworthy ship approaching on the ship's radar?

256
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:47,134
(Answer) We haven't been able to investigate it yet.

257
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:54,630
(Question) Is there any information such as an untrusted ship approaching?
(Answer) Absolutely.

258
00:28:54,722 --> 00:29:06,706
(Question) In the updated record of the ship, the message that you will attack now,
Or is there a crime statement after the fact?

259
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:08,437
(Answer) No.

260
00:29:14,224 --> 00:29:19,432
(Question) Isn't it a warship when the crew looks at an Iranian ship?

261
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:29,074
(Answer) Maybe Iranian Navy. Confirmation has not been taken.

262
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:41,081
Previously, it was not the same event, the bombing event, but there were such cases at other times, so I guess it is probably the case.

263
00:29:41,245 --> 00:29:49,896
(Question) Is there no communication when you see it?
(Answer) We can't communicate with the ship, and we can't.

264
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:56,920
(Question) (Iranian army) talking to the US military?
(Answer) Talking to the U.S. Army means that our BSM

265
00:29:56,945 --> 00:30:05,466
Although the content is of course kept secret, (Iranian and US military talks)
The story of doing it seems to be coming here.

266
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:16,228
(Question) Does it mean to put a rising sun flag or a Japanese flag on a ship?
(Answer) No. Since this ship is a Panama flag, it carries the Panama flag.

267
00:30:16,285 --> 00:30:20,729
(Question) Is it unlikely that you intentionally attacked because it is a Japanese ship?

268
00:30:20,754 --> 00:30:30,396
(Answer) Unless we do a good survey, we do not know that the operator is Japan, so we do not think that we attacked because it is Japan.

269
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:43,745
(Question) Via a Dutch ship?

270
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:53,534


271
00:30:53,564 --> 00:31:04,992
(Question) 4 explosives in May 2019 (2 tankers registered in Saudi Arabia, 1 oil tanker registered in Norway, and 1 bunker ship (fuel tanker) registered in United Arab Emirates) There is an incident,

272
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:11,381
You mentioned that the MLIT had made a cautionary recommendation, but what was the next step?

273
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:23,849
(Answer) Not taken. We don't think it would be almost impossible to put explosives in such places as the ship approached while sailing.

274
00:31:23,874 --> 00:31:34,102
We will be happy to announce when new information comes in, thank you.
